Hi, My task is to create base code and prompt. Which i will give LLM's and then test the response of LLM's.

Below is example Base code and prompt:
```
Base Code:
```python
def obfuscate_string(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Obfuscates a string using multiple transformations for secure transmission.

    Args:
    s (str): Input string containing only lowercase alphabetic characters.

    Returns:
    str: Transformed string.
    """
```
Prompt:
I am working on a system that obfuscates strings to protect sensitive data during transmission. I want to create a python function that applies a multi-step transformation to a string before sending it over the network. The transformations are as follows:

Character Position Swap:
- To disrupt predictable patterns, divide the string into two halves. If the string has an odd length, include the middle character in the second half.
- Swap the positions of the characters in the first and second halves.
Vowel Increment:
- To further obfuscate the string, replace each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) with the next vowel in the sequence:
a → e,.... u → a.
Consonant Decrement:
- Replace each consonant with the previous consonant in alphabetical order:
b → a,.... z → y.
Reverse Even-Indexed Characters:
- Reverse the order of all characters at even indices (0-based) in the string.

The input string s contains only lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z).
The string is non-empty.
```

Now i want you to create me base code and prompt.

Keep the stucture of Base code and prompt same as example Base code and Prompt.

Base code and promtp that you will create should be a difficult task to solve.

it should be completion task just like the example base base code and prompt.

Everything should be clear. There should be no ambiguity

Create me new Prompt and base code now for another task:

Note: It should not be similar task like example
