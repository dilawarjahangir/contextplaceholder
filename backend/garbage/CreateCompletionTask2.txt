Hi, My task is to create base code and prompt. Which i will give LLM's and then test the response of LLM's.

Below is example Base code and prompt:
```
Base Code:
```python
def evaluate_custom_expressions(expressions: List[str]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Evaluates a list of arithmetic expressions using modified operator precedence rules.

    Args:
    expressions (List[str]): A list of non-empty strings, each representing a valid arithmetic expression 
                             composed of non-negative integers, the '+' and '*' operators, and parentheses.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of integers where each integer is the result of evaluating the corresponding expression.
    """
```
Prompt:

I am developing a specialized calculator that must evaluate arithmetic expressions with non-standard operator precedence. Unlike conventional evaluation, the rules for your function are as follo>

1. Parentheses First: Evaluate any expressions within parentheses before handling the rest of the expression.
2. Modified Operator Precedence: In the absence of parentheses, perform addition ('+') operations before multiplication ('*'), regardless of their positions in the expression.
3. Left-Associativity: Both '+' and '*' operators should be treated as left-associative.
4. Expression Format:
   - Each expression is provided as a non-empty string containing only digits (0-9), the operators '+' and '*', and properly matched parentheses.
   - There are no spaces in any expression.
   - All numbers are valid non-negative integers and will not have leading zeros.

Your task is to implement a Python function that processes a list of such expressions and returns a list of results. Each result must be computed strictly following the modified precedence rules

```

Now i want you to create me base code and prompt.

Keep the stucture of Base code and prompt same as example Base code and Prompt.

Base code and promtp that you will create should be a difficult task to solve.

it should be completion task just like the example base base code and prompt.

Everything should be clear. There should be no ambiguity

Create me new Prompt and base code now for another task:

Note: It should not be similar task like example
