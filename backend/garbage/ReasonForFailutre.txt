Hello,

My task is to create a prompt, base code, and test cases to validate the code generated by a language model. I am providing four components:

1. **Base Code and Prompt**: The original code and prompt given to the language model.
2. **Generated Code**: The code produced by the language model based on the base code and prompt.
3. **Test Cases**: Test cases designed to thoroughly code generated by language model to test weather the generated code is correctly following base code and prompt
4. **Failure Stacktrace**: The error stacktrace that occurs when the generated code fails.

**Details:**

**Base Code and Prompt:**

{{Base code and prompt}}


**Generated Code:**

{{Code}}


**Test Cases:**

**Failure Stacktrace:**

**Instruction:**  
Please perform a deep analysis of the provided components and identify logical reason for the failure, expressed in a single line statement.
